# Telco-churn-prediction-with-Machine Learning Algorithms
As someone passionate about data analysis, I built this project to predict customer churn in a telecom company using Machine Learning algorithms.
The goal is to detect customers likely to leave the company, based on real data (contracts, services, payments, history...), and support retention strategies.
This project highlights my skills in data exploration, predictive modeling, and data visualization.
