# Telco-churn-prediction-with-Machine Learning Algorithms
As someone passionate about data analysis, I built this project to predict customer churn in a telecom company using Machine Learning algorithms.
The goal is to detect customers likely to leave the company, based on real data (contracts, services, payments, history...), and support retention strategies.
This project highlights my skills in data exploration, predictive modeling, and data visualization.
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
ðŸ§ª Project Pipeline
The script is divided into 6 main steps:

1. ðŸ“¥ Data Loading
Loading the Telco dataset from a CSV file.

2. ðŸ“Š Data Visualization (Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ EDA)
Global overview of the data structure, variable types, missing values, and initial descriptive statistics.

3. ðŸ“ˆ Univariate Data Visualization
Graphical analysis of each variable individually to understand its distribution.

4. ðŸ“‰ Bivariate Analysis
Study of the relationships between independent variables and the target variable Churn.

5. ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
Preparing the data for modeling: encoding categorical variables, normalization, handling missing values, and splitting the data into train/test sets.

6. ðŸ¤– Modeling
Training various classification models (e.g., SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score.
